# Operations with Matrices

This program performs operations with matrices.

Several basic operations have already been implemented:

- Add matrices
- Multiply matrix by a constant
- Multiply two matrices


I plan to add the following matrix transformations:
- Transpose of a matrix
- Affine transformation
- Inversion of matrices
- Trace of a matrix
- Calculate a determinant of a matrix
- ...

Technologies:
- Python 3.7

Project status: under developement
